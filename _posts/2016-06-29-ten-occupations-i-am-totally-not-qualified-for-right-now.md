Ten Occupations I am Totally Not Qualified for right now

1. doctor or nurse
2. lawyer
3. accountant
4. police officer
5. electrician
6. EMT
7. fireman
8. chef
9. mortgage loan officer
10. investment financial planner

But here is how I can be one of these today in this moment. 

**Doctor**

- I could take a patient's temperature, note their symptoms, refer them to a specialist, clean/bandage small wounds and give tips on how to live a healthy life. 

**Lawyer**

- I could tap into my knowledge and interest in copyright law to determine if an entity or someone is using someone else's intellectual property in a manner which violates their IP rights. 

**Accountant**

- I could file a tax return online through HR Block or Turbo Tax. 

**Police Officer**

- I could make a citizen's arrest, help an elderly person out or do surveillance on a shady character. 

**Electrician**

- I could do preventative household maintenance, make sure appliances and things which plug into an outlet are not overloading a circuit. Troubleshoot electrical outlets. 

**EMT**

- I could perform immediate triage on a person who is injured, clean/bandage small wounds or help someone get through a panic attack. 

**Fireman**

- I could perform preventative fire maintenance around the house by clearing dead scrub brush from the property and also get people out of harms way quickly in most scenarios. 

**Chef**

- I could dice, cut, prepare ingredients which go into making a meal. I can cook basic meals. 

**Mortgage Loan Officer**

- I can research, comparison shop and choose/recommend mortgage loans for a person's unique situation. 

**Investment / Financial Planner**

- I can buy index funds, mirror Warren Buffet's investments, set up a plan to save money for retirement, establish a plan for paying off debt.
